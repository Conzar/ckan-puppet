<TODO>

Fixes:
  - Output of new CKAN Fact now correctly reports if the /etc/ckan/plugins.out file doesn't exist.

Version 1.0.12
==============

Summary:
Ext Plugin Reworked

Changes:
 - Including extension plugins in the plugins parameter caused the module to fail due to a depedancy on the extension to already be installed prior to ckan started.
   This patch incorperates the plugin into the extension so the extension plugins no longer need to be set via the plugin option.
   It will require 2 puppet runs in order to bring the extensions online though (there isn't any way around this that I know of).
